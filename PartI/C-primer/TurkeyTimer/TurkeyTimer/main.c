// A function can have many local variables, and all of them are stored in the `frame` for that function. The frame is only present while the function is being executed.
// Frames are stored in memory at a place called a `stack`. When a function is called its frame gets `pushed` on top of the `stack` and when the function terminates execution its frame gets `popped` off the stack.

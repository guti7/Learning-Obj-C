/// Property attributes:
/// Properties are either `atomic` or `nonatomic` and their difference is related to their behavior in a multithreading environment. Use `atomic` to help prevent corruption of data in a multithreading environment. It does not necessarily mean that the code will be safe.
/// Multi - use `atomic` - default bevahior
/// single - use `nonatomic`

/// 'Read-only' properties(as constants) - a property whose value can be read but not changed once it has been set. The compiler creates only a getter accessor method for this attribute. In contrast, there is `readwrite` properties, which is the default behavior.

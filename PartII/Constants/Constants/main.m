    /// Preprocessor directives:
    /// Compiling a file in C, C++, or Objective-C code is done in two passes. First, the *preprocessor* runs through the file. The output from the *preprocessor* then goes into the real compiler. Preprocessor directives start with '#'.
    
    /// `#include` vs. `#import`: They do essentially the same thing, the preprocessor reads a file and adds it to its output. You include a header (declarations) file and the compiler uses this to understand the code it is compiling. `#import` signifies the preprocessor to include the file once. `#include` will allow you to include the same file many times.
    
    /// `#define` is a preprocessor directive that tells the compiler to replace 'A' with 'B'. When it's used to do function-like stuff instead of simply substituting a value, you are creating a 'macro'.
